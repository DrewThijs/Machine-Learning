# Machine-Learning
There are my work on Machine Learning without using Octave and some other knowledge applied based on provided data exercise in Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng. 
The idea flow may be a bit complicated to comprehend so if you have any questions just send me an e-mail via 'vietthang.lea@gmail.com' (I don't know how to edit it on ipynb file - Sorry for that). I hope this can help you guys in applying Python for ML.
As I just leave my work in the most coherent, it requires a strong and fundamental background of Mathametics.
